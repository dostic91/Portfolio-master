                    My name is Dejan Dostic. I'm born on October 6, 1991.
                    Prior to my interest in programming, I studied mechanical engineering at the Faculty of Techical Sciences in Novi Sad, Serbia.
                    In my free time I love to play chess and also enjoy basketball, either playing or watching a good game.

                <h3>FTN Informatika: Programming basics</h3>
                <p>
                    I attended this course in order to learn basics of programming. 
                    Some of the stuff that I learned at this course are the main principles of the OOP in JAVA programming language and how to use version control tools.

                <h3>FTN Informatika: Test Development</h3>
                <p>
                    My next step on my learning path was to apply for Test Development Course. 
                    There I had oportunity to learn some more advanced concepts such as basics of web devolpement and web communication, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and how to combine them.
                    Also, I learned what API's are and how to communicate with them using HTTP requests.
                    Finnaly, I was introduced to fundamentals of relational databases and how to query them. 
                    At the end of the course, I realized that I'm more interested in Web Development than Testing, but I'm glad I learned that as well.
